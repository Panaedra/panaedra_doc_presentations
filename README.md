# panaedra_doc_presentations

Presentations of Panaedra technologies. Look at the releases for binary files/documents.

## PUG Challenge Prague, 2017-11-17

1. All ABL demo's can be found in the [panaedra_oe_platform_base](https://github.com/Panaedra/panaedra_oe_platform_base) repository. Look inside the `devshelve` directory. Some demo's have a Python counterpart file, which can be found in the [panaedra_py_platform_base](https://github.com/Panaedra/panaedra_py_platform_base) repository's `devshelve`.
1. InfluxDB/Grafana demo:
    - I shared a snapshot of the dashboard at [raintank](https://snapshot.raintank.io/dashboard/snapshot/4qbsmW0g0barrg4R1CU7oReGp4FLs48Q).
    - For the snapshot to work, I had to throw away the `select by day/week/month/quarter` dropdown list, and the `PieChart` example, since these are not supported by the raintank snapshotting server.
1. Nanosecond benchmarking of an incrementing `longchar`: please go to the releases page, you can download the complete Excel workbook that was created in the demo from there.
1. The powerpoint presentation is also in the releases on this GitHub repository
1. Many thanks for all the positive feedback on my presentation
