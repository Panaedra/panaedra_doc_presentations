## PUG Challenge Prague, 2017-11-17

1. First, have a look at the [released documentation](https://github.com/Panaedra/panaedra_doc_presentations/releases/tag/2017-11-17). Some additional info:
    1. InfluxDB/Grafana demo:
        - I shared a snapshot of the dashboard at [raintank](https://snapshot.raintank.io/dashboard/snapshot/4qbsmW0g0barrg4R1CU7oReGp4FLs48Q).
        - For the snapshot to work, I had to throw away the `select by day/week/month/quarter` dropdown list, and the `PieChart` example, since these are not supported by the raintank snapshotting server.
    1. Nanosecond benchmarking of an incrementing `longchar`: please go to the [releases](https://github.com/Panaedra/panaedra_doc_presentations/releases/tag/2017-11-17) page, you can download the complete Excel workbook that was created in the demo from there.
    1. The powerpoint presentation is also in the [releases](https://github.com/Panaedra/panaedra_doc_presentations/releases/tag/2017-11-17) of this GitHub repository
1. All sourcecode of the ABL demo's can be found in the [panaedra_oe_platform_base](https://github.com/Panaedra/panaedra_oe_platform_base) repository. Look inside the `devshelve` directory. 
    - Some demo's have a Python counterpart file, which can be found in the [panaedra_py_platform_base](https://github.com/Panaedra/panaedra_py_platform_base) repository's `devshelve`.
1. Many thanks for all the positive feedback on my presentation
